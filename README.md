Alumni management system is a dedicated solution or software aimed at enabling organizations -
usually colleges and universities, to be in constant touch with the Alumni. An Alumni (Alumnus) is a
graduate or former student of a particular school, college, or university. AIMS provide a platform
for Alumni members to connect among themselves and maintain a close relationship with their
Alma Mater. Alma Mater is a school, college, or university which one has attended or from which
one has graduated. Using a reliable Alumni information management software solution, the
platform can allow Alumni members and other graduates to connect.
